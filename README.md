Semantic Intelligence: GPT-4 + A* Path Planning for Low-Cost Robotics
This repository implements a hybrid navigation system that combines GPT-4's semantic reasoning with classical A* path planning on a low-cost Petoi Bittle quadruped robot. The system enables context-aware navigation through natural language instructions without hardcoded finite state machines.
