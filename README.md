# Petoi-Bittle-Bot-A-vs-GPT-for-Path-Planning-and-Hybrid-Simple-Semantics
This repository consists of the code to run a Petoi Bittle bot through evaluations to compare path planning of A* vs GPT. In addition, you can test a hybrid environment where A* plans the path and GPT chooses accordingly (with semantics involved to test GPT's choice selection).
